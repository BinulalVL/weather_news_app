# 🌦 Weather and News Aggregator App

This Flutter application is built as part of the machine test for the Flutter Developer position at JIITAK.
It is designed to display current weather and filtered news articles using GetX for state management.

## 🙏 A Note from the Developer

Due to time constraints, I focused heavily on the UI/UX and overall structure.
The weather page backend was scaffolded with ChatGPT to avoid leaving it incomplete. 
I would be happy to complete full API integration and any missing features if given a short extension.
I truly enjoyed this challenge and look forward to your feedback!
